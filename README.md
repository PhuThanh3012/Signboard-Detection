# Signboard-Detection
**Context:**\
With the rapid development of urban areas and the rapid expansion of commercial areas, shop signs are increasingly appearing densely and diversely in the urban environment. The recognition and analysis of these signs brings many important applications, thereby supporting the mapping system, navigation, providing data for advertising services and market research. The problem of signboard detection helps to determine the location and content of shop signs from images or videos collected in the real environment.

However, unlike other recognition problems, signs are often very diverse in shape, size, color and design style. Many signs also use special fonts, images, or symbols to attract attention, making accurate recognition even more complicated. The difference is that the dataset will focus on signs in the context of urban areas in Vietnam, with many local cultural elements, creating a new challenge for artificial intelligence models.

**Input data:**\
The model is fine-tuned with a custom dataset containing various types of signboards specific to Vietnam. This includes but is not limited to road signs, store advertisements, and safety instructions, each with different text, colors, and shapes, making the detection more accurate for local conditions.

The dataset might also include complex backgrounds, varying lighting conditions, and different angles of signboard placement, which are common in Vietnamese cities.

**Challenges Addressed:**\
The model handles challenges like occlusion (when part of the sign is blocked), various lighting conditions (day/night), and varying angles at which signs are captured.

It can also cope with language-specific issues (e.g., Vietnamese characters on signs) by detecting and processing textual information effectively
