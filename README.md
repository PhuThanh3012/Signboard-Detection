# Signboard-Detection
**Context**
With the rapid development of urban areas and the rapid expansion of commercial areas, shop signs are increasingly appearing densely and diversely in the urban environment. The recognition and analysis of these signs brings many important applications, thereby supporting the mapping system, navigation, providing data for advertising services and market research. The problem of signboard detection helps to determine the location and content of shop signs from images or videos collected in the real environment.

However, unlike other recognition problems, signs are often very diverse in shape, size, color and design style. Many signs also use special fonts, images, or symbols to attract attention, making accurate recognition even more complicated. The difference is that the dataset will focus on signs in the context of urban areas in Vietnam, with many local cultural elements, creating a new challenge for artificial intelligence models.
